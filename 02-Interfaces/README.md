# Abstract Classes and Interfaces Challlenge:

Decisions are hard especially when you are hungry. This is a simple console application that takes your order. It starts by asking if you would like lunch or dinner and continues on until all selections have been made and then outputs your choices.

## What you are supposed to do:

1. Read Chapt. 2 in Design Patterns in C# by Steven John Metsker and read through the material on the Dev Book Club site (http://devbookclub.io/2016/08/02/chapter-2-interfaces-and-abstract-classes/). 

2. Use your new knowledge to refact the application to utilize an Abstract Class and/or Interface as you see fit. There are several ways to go about this and the fun will come from comparing what everyone comes up with and discussing why they did what they did!
