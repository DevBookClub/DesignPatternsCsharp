# Adapter Pattern Challenge:

This application asks what meal you would like to eat (breakfast, lunch or dinner). It then takes a in an int and returns the cooresponding enumeration value. This is great except their is another application implementing the ITarget inteface that expects the same information only as a string. 

## What you are supposed to do:

1. Read Chapt. 3 in Design Patterns in C# by Steven John Metsker and read through the material on the Dev Book Club site (http://devbookclub.io/2016/08/22/chapter-3-adapter-pattern/).

2. Use your new knowledge to refactor the application to use the Adapter Pattern.
