This pattern is implemented to mask over-complexity. By isolating the information being used and applying it within its own class, code is made more readable and maintainable.

You've inherited 3 hellishly monsterous classes and tasked with the job of isolating 3 key ingredients to make a great camp fire. 

## Challenge

Implement the Facade Pattern to make this code easier to read and maintain by creating a class specific to the need.
